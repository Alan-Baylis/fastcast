### Share audio and video

**Fastcast** is a website for streaming audio and video content. The content is shared across a peer-to-peer network. Fastcast is powered by [WebTorrent](http://webtorrent.io): a streaming torrent client for node.js and the browser. This allows torrent files to be streamed in the browser. This project is open to contribution.

### How do I use it?
First of all, you need to download one of the videos by visiting [fastcast.nz/seed.html](http://fastcast.nz/seed.html). Download one file, for example, take the first video (AGITATION | NEW ZEALAND 4K).

Once downloaded, now you need to start seeding the video - for this scroll to the bottom of the page. In the selection box, select the video you downloaded, and if all goes well you should see in the logs "Creating .torrent file..."

Then go to the video page, in our case it's http://fastcast.nz/videos/agitation-new-zealand-4k.html.

As a result, we see the video streaming at the page and we can invite our friends to see.
