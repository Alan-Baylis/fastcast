Fastcast
========

**Fastcast** is a website for streaming audio and video content. The content is shared across a peer-to-peer network. Fastcast is powered by [WebTorrent](http://webtorrent.io): a streaming torrent client for node.js and the browser. This allows torrent files to be streamed in the browser. This project is open to contribution.
